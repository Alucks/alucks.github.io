    <h2>Alex Gennette</h2>
    <h3 class="subhead">A design portfolio</h3>
    <p>I am a product design and artist based on Oakland, California. During the day I'm leading design for the <a href="https://www.netflix.com/games">Netflix Games Platform</a>, and at night I spend time <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alucks/">taking photos</a> and drawing.</p>  
    <p>Previously I worked as a design lead at <a href="https://www.playstation.com">PlayStation</a>, focusing on the new UI of the PS5.</p>
    <p>Some Publications highlighting my work include <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/14/23829262/netflix-cloud-gaming-testing-tv-web">Netflix Cloud Gaming(The Verge)</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772480/netflix-games-apple-iphone-ipad-ios-subscription-app-store">Netflix Mobile Games(The Verge)</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/27/23375319/netflix-games-gamertag-username-handle-ios-android">Netflix Games Handles(The Verge)</a>, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2020/10/15/first-look-playstation-5s-next-generation-user-experience/"> a first look at the PS5 UX(PS Blog)</a> and finally the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/14/ps5s-september-system-software-update-launches-globally-tomorrow/">First major PS5 update(PS Blog)</a></p>

    <p>This is a placeholder site while I'm updating my portfolio with something fun. In the meantime, enjoy the tiny 3D model I made below.</p>
