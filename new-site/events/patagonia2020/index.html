      <p>Join Tiny Atlas on our return trip to Chilean Patagonia with Upscape. We’re leading two epic adventures through continuously changing and stunning terrain with unlimited opportunities for wildlife encounters, rushing water, and photography. Our first trip to Patagonia in March 2019 had such an incredible response that we decided to do it all over again, making a few improvements to the trip based on our experience last year. In addition, since our community interest in Torres del Paine is so high, we created an additional trip with a longer itinerary that takes us down to the otherworldly landscape of Torres del Paine.</p>
      <p>Both Patagonia trips feature multi-night stays at Outpost Patagonia. Set on the shores of the Jeinimeni River, a legendary sportfishing spot, just a few hours’ drive off of the Carretera Austral, Outpost Patagonia is a pop-up camp, complete with kitchen and living room dome tents, private guest tents with living rooms and insulated sleeping pods and shared bathroom/showers.</p>
      <p>Throughout Trip 1 and Trip 2, we’ve chosen lodging to maximize your experience of where you are. Accommodations range from luxury boutique hotels to rustic campsites in order to provide you with best access to the South American landscape and opportunities to shoot from dawn till dusk, or into the night if you are wanting to play with astrophotography.</p>
      <p>
      <b>Unknown Patagonia</b> is a seven-day-trip through the Aysen region which is now famous for the Patagonia National Park donated by US philanthropist and conservationists Kris and Doug Tomkins. One of the region’s top hotels, warm and modern Borde Baker will be our base for 3 nights on the shore of the powerful Rio Baker. From here we will explore Patagonia National Park, trek on a glacier at the foot of San Lorenzo mountain, and visit Chile’s Marble Caves. The second half of our first itinerary brings us to an off-the-grid three night stay in Upscape’s Outpost, a glamping adventure campsite along the Rio Jenimeni. From camp we’ll venture through Valle Lunar to experience and capture the wild high desert with breathtaking views of multicolored stone cliffs and Lago General Carrera, the second largest lake in South America, with the endless pampas of Argentina beyond. We’ll celebrate our last night with a Chilean asado cooked by Don Camilo, our gaucho host for an authentic feast accompanied by cowboy music.
      </p>
      <p><b>Patagonia Explorer</b> is a twelve-night adventure for travelers who have more time to explore and with their sights set on a lifetime experience in Torres del Paine National Park. We’ll begin with a three-night stay at Outpost Patagonia and explore the Jeinimeni River and National Reserve. From there we’ll head to Chilean outdoor adventure town, Cochrane, for three nights. We’ll walk Calluqueo glacier, see the highest summit of Patagonia, the majestic San Lorenzo mountain, which marks the border with Argentina, and explore Parque Patagonia. Over the next two days you’ll stay at La Casona Hostel and visit the bright blue General Carrera Lake including the beautiful Marble Caves, and Cerro Castillo National Park. We will spend a night in the quaint town of Puerto Natales before finishing our trip with three nights at Rio Serrano Hotel and hiking and exploring Chile’s most famous park, Torres del Paine.</p>

      <h4>Testimonials</h4>
      <p>“Patagonia is a place that seeps into your soul and stays there, and my time spent there with Tiny Atlas was unlike any other travel experience I have ever had. The unimaginably beautiful and remote places you find yourself in, the care taken by the Upscape team to create an unforgettable journey, and the memories and laughs shared along the way made for an adventure beyond compare.”  - <i>Shelby Downs</i></p>
      <p>“We have so many nice memories of our trip in Chilean Patagonia with Tiny Atlas - perfect trip organization, wonderful landscapes, different experiences each day, nice and friendly local guides, charming hotels and campsites, and a lot of inspiration for photography. A change of scenery is guaranteed, thanks Emily!” - <i>Sabine Rolin</i></p>
      <p>“As a serious amateur landscape photographer, when I saw the post for a nearly 10 day photo workshop in Patagonia with not one, but two of my favorite photographers, I didn’t hesitate to book a spot. Not being very familiar with TAQ or Upscape Travel, I really didn’t know what to expect, but given the talent they were bringing along for the trip, in addition to new Hasselblad cameras being available for all attendees to use, I knew it would be a trip of a lifetime. And my expectations were even exceeded. The photography knowledge I gleaned from the two professionals, the accommodations we stayed at, the food we ate, and the places we trekked to to shoot have become cemented as some of my greatest memories and most valuable life experiences. I can’t wait to experience another TAQ adventure.  - <i>Nicholas Shelestak</i></p>
