        <div class="main-content" style="max-width:520px">
            <p>Join Tiny Atlas on our return trip to Chilean Patagonia with Upscape. We’re leading two epic adventures through continuously changing and stunning terrain with unlimited opportunities for wildlife encounters, rushing water, and photography.
                Our first trip to Patagonia in March 2019 had such an incredible response that we decided to do it all over again, making a few improvements to the trip based on our experience last year. In addition, since our community interest in Torres
                del Paine National Park is so high, we created an additional trip with a longer itinerary that takes us down to that otherworldly landscape.</p>
            <p>Both Patagonia trips feature multi-night stays at Outpost Patagonia. Set on the shores of the Jeinimeni River, a legendary sportfishing spot, just a few hours’ drive off of the Carretera Austral, Outpost Patagonia is a pop-up camp, complete
                with kitchen and living room dome tents, private guest tents with living rooms and insulated sleeping pods and shared bathroom/showers.</p>
            <p>Throughout the trips, we’ve chosen lodging to maximize your experience where you are. Accommodations range from luxury boutique hotels to glamping campsites in order to provide you with best access to the South American landscape and opportunities
                to experience and photograph from dawn till dusk, or into the night if you are wanting to play with astrophotography.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Unknown Patagonia</b> is a seven-day-trip through the Aysen region which is now famous for the Patagonia National Park donated by US philanthropist and conservationists Kris and Doug Tomkins. One of the region’s top hotels, warm and
                modern Borde Baker will be our base for 3 nights on the shore of the powerful Rio Baker. From here we will explore Patagonia National Park, trek on a glacier at the foot of San Lorenzo mountain, and visit Chile’s Marble Caves. The second
                half of this itinerary will bring us to an off-the-grid three night stay in Upscape’s Outpost, a glamping adventure campsite along the Jenimeni river. From camp we’ll venture through Valle Lunar to experience and capture the wild high
                desert with breathtaking views of multicolored stone cliffs and Lago General Carrera, the second largest lake in South America, with the endless pampas of Argentina beyond. We’ll celebrate our last night with a Chilean asado cooked by
                Don Camilo, our gaucho host for an authentic feast accompanied by cowboy music.
            </p>
            <p><b>Patagonia Explorer</b> is a thirteen night adventure for travelers who have more time to explore and with their sights set on a lifetime experience in Torres del Paine National Park. We’ll begin with a three-night stay at Outpost Patagonia
                and explore the Jeinimeni River and National Reserve. From there we’ll head to Chilean outdoor adventure town, Cochrane, for three nights. We’ll walk Calluqueo glacier, see the highest summit of Patagonia, the majestic San Lorenzo mountain,
                which marks the border with Argentina, and explore Parque Patagonia. Over the next two days you’ll stay at La Casona Hostel and visit the wildly blue General Carrera Lake including the beautiful Marble Caves, and Cerro Castillo National
                Park. We will spend a night in the quaint town of Puerto Natales before finishing our trip with three nights at Rio Serrano Hotel and hiking and exploring Chile’s most famous park, Torres del Paine.</p>

            <h4>Testimonials</h4>
            <p>“Patagonia is a place that seeps into your soul and stays there, and my time spent there with Tiny Atlas was unlike any other travel experience I have ever had. The unimaginably beautiful and remote places you find yourself in, the care taken
                by the Upscape team to create an unforgettable journey, and the memories and laughs shared along the way made for an adventure beyond compare.” <br />- <i>Shelby D</i></p>
            <p>“We have so many nice memories of our trip in Chilean Patagonia with Tiny Atlas - perfect trip organization, wonderful landscapes, different experiences each day, nice and friendly local guides, charming hotels and campsites, and a lot of
                inspiration for photography. A change of scenery is guaranteed, thanks Emily!” <br />- <i>Sabine R</i></p>
            <p>“As a serious amateur landscape photographer, when I saw the post for a nearly 10 day photo workshop in Patagonia with not one, but two of my favorite photographers, I didn’t hesitate to book a spot. Not being very familiar with TAQ or Upscape
                Travel, I really didn’t know what to expect, but given the talent they were bringing along for the trip, in addition to new Hasselblad cameras being available for all attendees to use, I knew it would be a trip of a lifetime. And my expectations
                were even exceeded. The photography knowledge I gleaned from the two professionals, the accommodations we stayed at, the food we ate, and the places we trekked to to shoot have become cemented as some of my greatest memories and most valuable
                life experiences. I can’t wait to experience another TAQ adventure. <br />- <i>Nicholas S</i></p>

            <p><strong>Chiara Zonca, Photographer for Patagonia Explorer</strong></p>
            <p>Chiara Zonca is an Italian fine art photographer based in Western Canada. She is interested in portraying a connection between her feelings and the surroundings. By seeking isolated spaces as a form of exploration of self, Chiara documents
                specific moments in time when open spaces alter her landscape perception. This shift enables her to see past the present and investigate the earth as a timeless, wide open space where she can then project her narratives. Her work has been
                exhibited in Sydney, New York, Los Angeles and London and printed on a variety of publications including: The Earth Issue, Satori Mag, Jungle Magazine, NOICE and many more. In 2019 Chiara released her first monograph, Desert Portraits,
                by Scandinavian Publisher The New Heroes &amp; Pioneers, based on her series Moon Kingdom, available <a href="http://thenewheroesandpioneers.com/store/books/desert-portraits/">here</a>. You can find Chiara&rsquo;s work on Instagram at
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shadowontherun/">@shadowontherun</a> and her film imagery at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shadowonfilm/">@shadowonfilm</a> and on her <a href="https://chiarazonca.com/">website</a>. </p>

                <h4>Who is TAQ</h4>
